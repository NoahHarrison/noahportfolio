# BusMap

This project demonstrates the timeout feature in maps and how maps can be used.

## How to Run
#### 1. Running the project locally.
- To run this project locally, first clone the repository using `git clone`.
- Once the project is cloned, go to the directory of the cloned repo and open it using VSCode
- Make sure you have the extension called `Live Server` in order to launch the project page locally.

## Roadmap of future improvements

- Since this is only the beginning of launching a full fledged version PacMan, here's some potential improvements:
1.  adding visual markers for each stop along the bus path.
2.  adding names to the bus stops.
